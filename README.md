# BuySellGold

The task is to buy and sell gold, with one big advantage- you know how the price varies over time.

You have to buy exactly once and sell exactly once, after the day you buy. The objective is to maximize the result. If you cannot make a positive result you will have to minimize the loss.

There are two solutions:
1-Find the best day to buy and best day to sell, once!
2-Find best days to buy and best days to sell.
